        Crossroads Coffee Cafe your home away from home!

        Clean, casual, and conveniently located just off I-205
        in Gladstone, exit 11 in the High Rocks neighborhood.

        The atmosphere is "family-living-room" meets "Boardroom".

        Our beautiful chairs, couches, and meeting areas are lush and "new"… come put your feet up and relax!

        We invite you to allow our family to serve your family, guests, work or study group as you linger over fine coffee, and wonderful deli options.

        The deli, as unique as each visitor, is prepared to serve wonderful healthy
        (and hearty) options from vegetarian to meaty, from organic to "load 'er up" naughty!

        We even serve sugar free pastries that’ll have you questioning whether they’re really sugar free.

        Crossroads Coffee Café is set up with free WiFi, and
        we offer live music (easy listening) on Friday and Saturday nights!
